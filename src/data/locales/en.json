That way, I could use the same plugins across all my devices.\n\nWell, and then I thought: if I’m doing that anyway, I might as well put the whole thing on GitHub so I can access it from anywhere — and share it with the world in case anyone else might find it useful.\n\nAnd that’s when the classic old programmer syndrome kicked in: *“This should really be maintainable with Renovate — if I make the plugins machine-readable and download them automatically.”*\n\nThat’s how this project came to be. Progress is at about 80% now, and I’m pretty happy with how it’s turning out. :)"
